        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I&apos;m a monkey who comes from Monkeyland. You wouldn&apos;t have heard of it and we like to keep it that way. My dad sent me to Germany to learn proper german (something to do with why our surname is Affer) and my Being here has decided to learn all this IT stuff so I&apos;m doing that now too.</p>
        <p>I like food. All kinds of food, but I really like strawberries</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I don&apos;t have any particular goals, so I&apos;m just going to put down what my Being wants:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>He says he wants to diversify his abilities to improve his prospectives on the job market. I don&apos;t know why I&apos;d want or need to learn any of that.</p>
