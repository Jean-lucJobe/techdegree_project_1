            <h2>Resume</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>2005 - 2008: attended monkeyville highschool.</li>
                <li>2008 - 2012: was sent to Germany by my dad to attended a highschool there. I&apos;m also supposed to learn &quot;deutsch&quot; and how to interact with Beings. That&apos;s apparently important to running the family business.</li>
                <li>2012 - 2017: studied IT some University which my Being enrolled at aswell. My dad would have preferred I studied business management for when I take over the family business but I thought it would be easier to do same as what my Being is doing.</li>
                <li>2017 - present: I haven&apos;t done much, don&apos;t need to since my Being seems to do most of the stuff but he does moan about the food bill. He says I eat to much for how small I am.</li>
